        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY – OurStars</h1>
        <div class="last-updated">Last updated: December 15, 2025</div>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how OurStars ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you access or use our online services, including the OurStars game, website, and related platforms (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

        <p>By using OurStars, you acknowledge that this is an online application and that certain technical and personal data must be processed to ensure security, stability, and proper operation of the Services. By finalizing your registration, you agree to the terms in this document.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information necessary to operate, secure, and optimize our online Services, including hardware telemetry for security profiling.</p>

        <h3>a) Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect identifiers such as Username and Email address.</li>
            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> We collect content you voluntarily submit, such as in-game messages, images, and support tickets.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> We retain logs of purchases (e.g., dates, items purchased) for tax, legal, and support purposes, though we do not store full credit card numbers (handled by third-party processors).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b) Automatic Data Collection & Hardware Telemetry</h3>
        <p>By registering, you authorize us to capture and store technical data from your device to ensure fair play and system integrity, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> For location and security logging.</li>
            <li><strong>MAC Address & Hardware IDs:</strong> To uniquely identify your machine.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Connection timestamps, session duration, and error logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c) Cookies</h3>
        <p>We use essential cookies for authentication and session management.</p>

        <h2>2. Monitoring of Communications</h2>
        <p>To ensure the safety and civility of the community, we reserve the right to monitor content on our servers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> You acknowledge that Moderators and Administrators may review in-game communications and private messages (PMs/DMs) strictly when investigating reports of misconduct, harassment, illegal activity, or Terms of Service violations.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> While we respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality for communications sent through our game servers if valid safety concerns arise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected data for legitimate operational purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing and maintaining the online Services.</li>
            <li>Authenticating users and managing accounts.</li>
            <li>Preventing fraud, abuse, cheating, and unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Account Deletion, Data Retention, and Security Quarantine</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Right to Delete (Account Closure)</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your account at any time. To initiate this process, you must contact our support team.</p>

        <h3>b) Security Retention Period (1 to 2 Years)</h3>
        <p>Upon your request for deletion, your account access will be immediately blocked/deactivated. However, strictly for security purposes, fraud prevention, anti-cheat enforcement, and legal compliance, <strong>your data will remain stored on our secure servers for a period of 1 to 2 years (12 to 24 months)</strong>.</p>

        <h3>c) Permanent Deletion</h3>
        <p>After the retention period expires, all personal identifiers and data associated with your account will be permanently deleted from our live databases, provided there are no active legal disputes or investigations involving the account.</p>

        <h2>5. Virtual Goods, Refund Policy, and Termination</h2>

        <h3>a) Nature of Digital Items (Consumables)</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge that "Gems," "Coins," and other in-game items ("Virtual Goods") are digital content that serves as a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use a feature within the Service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consumable Service:</strong> Similar to consumable physical goods (e.g., food), once Virtual Goods are delivered to your account or used, the service is considered "fully executed" and cannot be returned or restored.</li>
            <li><strong>No Ownership:</strong> You do not own Virtual Goods; you hold a license to use them while your account is active.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b) Ban Policy and Forfeiture</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate our rules (e.g., cheating, hacking, toxicity, or terms violation).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Breach of Contract:</strong> A ban is a result of a breach of contract on your part. In the event of an account termination due to such violations, <strong>you forfeit all licenses to Virtual Goods and balances.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>No Refunds on Bans:</strong> You acknowledge that OurStars is not liable to provide refunds for any unused Virtual Goods or time if your account is banned for violating our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c) Refund Exceptions (Fraud Only)</h3>
        <p>Refunds are strictly limited to technical errors (non-delivery of items) or proven unauthorized transactions (fraud). We do not offer refunds for "change of mind" or for accounts that have been suspended due to misconduct.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We apply industry-standard protections, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS / TLS).</li>
            <li>Secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).</li>
            <li>Access controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite all efforts, no online system is 100% secure. You acknowledge the inherent risks of providing information online.</p>

        <h2>7. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal data. Information is shared only when strictly necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted infrastructure providers under confidentiality agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, court order, or valid legal process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>OurStars operates globally. By using the Services, you agree that your information may be transferred, stored, and processed on servers located outside your country of residence.</p>

        <h2>9. Minors and Parental Responsibility</h2>
        
        <h3>a) Parental Supervision</h3>
        <p>If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction (a "Minor"), you may only use the Services with the approval and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

        <h3>b) Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Parents or guardians are responsible for interpreting these terms for the Minor and for the Minor’s use of the Services. We encourage parents to monitor their children's online activity.</p>

        <h3>c) Parental Rights</h3>
        <p>Parents have the right to review the personal information collected from their child and may request the deletion of such information by contacting support.</p>

        <h2>10. Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notification:</strong> We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</li>
            <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Continued use of the Services after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have questions regarding your data, account status, or to request account deletion, please contact us at:</p>
