Last updated: December 15, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how OurStars ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you access or use our online services, including the OurStars game, website, and related platforms (collectively, the “Services”).
By using OurStarsClub, you acknowledge that this is an online application and that certain technical and personal data must be processed to ensure security, stability, and proper operation of the Services. By finalizing your registration, you agree to the terms in this document.
1. Information We Collect
We collect information necessary to operate, secure, and optimize our online Services, including hardware telemetry for security profiling.
a) Information You Provide to Us
Account Information: When you create an account, we collect identifiers such as Username and Email address.
User Content: We collect content you voluntarily submit, such as in-game messages, images, and support tickets.
Transaction Data: We retain logs of purchases (e.g., dates, items purchased) for tax, legal, and support purposes, though we do not store full credit card numbers (handled by third-party processors).
b) Automatic Data Collection & Hardware Telemetry
By registering, you authorize us to capture and store technical data from your device to ensure fair play and system integrity, including:
IP Address: For location and security logging.
MAC Address & Hardware IDs: To uniquely identify your machine.
Usage Data: Connection timestamps, session duration, and error logs.
c) Cookies
We use essential cookies for authentication and session management.
2. Monitoring of Communications
To ensure the safety and civility of the community, we reserve the right to monitor content on our servers.
Moderation: You acknowledge that Administrators may review in-game communications and private messages (PMs/DMs) strictly when investigating reports of misconduct, harassment, illegal activity, or Terms of Service violations.
Privacy: While we respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality for communications sent through our game servers if valid safety concerns arise.
3. How We Use Your Information
We use collected data for legitimate operational purposes, including:
Providing and maintaining the online Services.
Authenticating users and managing accounts.
Preventing fraud, abuse, cheating, and unauthorized access.
Complying with legal obligations.
4. Account Deletion, Data Retention, and Security Quarantine
a) Right to Delete (Account Closure)
You have the right to request the deletion of your account at any time. To initiate this process, you must contact our support team.
b) Security Retention Period (1 to 2 Years)
Upon your request for deletion, your account access will be immediately blocked/deactivated. However, strictly for security purposes, fraud prevention, anti-cheat enforcement, and legal compliance, your data will remain stored on our secure servers for a period of 1 to 2 years (12 to 24 months).
c) Permanent Deletion
After the retention period expires, all personal identifiers and data associated with your account will be permanently deleted from our live databases, provided there are no active legal disputes or investigations involving the account.
5. Virtual Goods, Refund Policy, and Termination
a) Nature of Digital Items (Consumables)
You acknowledge that "Gems," "Coins," and other in-game items ("Virtual Goods") are digital content that serves as a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use a feature within the Service.
Consumable Service: Similar to consumable physical goods (e.g., food), once Virtual Goods are delivered to your account or used, the service is considered "fully executed" and cannot be returned or restored.
No Ownership: You do not own Virtual Goods; you hold a license to use them while your account is active.
b) Ban Policy and Forfeiture
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate our rules (e.g., cheating, hacking, toxicity, or terms violation).
Breach of Contract: A ban is a result of a breach of contract on your part. In the event of an account termination due to such violations, you forfeit all licenses to Virtual Goods and balances.
No Refunds on Bans: You acknowledge that OurStarsClub is not liable to provide refunds for any unused Virtual Goods or time if your account is banned for violating our Terms of Service.
c) Refund Exceptions (Fraud Only)
Refunds are strictly limited to technical errors (non-delivery of items) or proven unauthorized transactions (fraud). We do not offer refunds for "change of mind" or for accounts that have been suspended due to misconduct.
6. Data Security
We apply industry-standard protections, including:
Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS / TLS).
Secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
Access controls.
Despite all efforts, no online system is 100% secure. You acknowledge the inherent risks of providing information online.

We do not sell personal data. Information is shared only when strictly necessary:
Service Providers: Trusted infrastructure providers under confidentiality agreements.

If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction (a "Minor"), you may only use the Services with the approval and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.
b) Responsibility
Parents or guardians are responsible for interpreting these terms for the Minor and for the Minor’s use of the Services. We encourage parents to monitor their children's online activity.
c) Parental Rights
Parents have the right to review the personal information collected from their child and may request the deletion of such information by contacting support.

<h3><strong>LICENSE</strong></h3>
<p>The Service contains a variety of: (i) materials and other items related to <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> and its products and services, and similar items from our licensors and other third parties, including all layout, information, text, data, files, images, scripts, designs, graphics, button icons, instructions, illustrations, photographs, audio clips, music, sounds, photos, videos, public advertisements, URLs, technology, software, communications, interactive resources, the "look" of the Service and the compilation, assembly and arrangement of the materials of the Service and all and any material protected by copyright (including source code and object code); (ii) trademarks, logos, trade names, service marks and business identities of various parties, including those of <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> (collectively, "Trademarks"); and (iii) other forms of intellectual property, all of the foregoing - (i) to (iii) - collectively "Content". Unless otherwise specified in writing, all Content is owned, controlled or licensed by <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> or its licensors. All Content is protected by copyright laws and/or similar laws protecting it from unauthorized use. The Trademarks, including but not limited to <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> and its logos, may not be used without the express written permission of <strong>OurStarsClub</strong>. You agree not to copy, redistribute, publish or exploit any Content that violates these Terms or any Additional Terms.</p>
<p>Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms, <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal and non-transferable license to (i) download (only temporary storage), view, display, use, reproduce and/or print a copy of the Content (excluding source code and raw object code or otherwise, except as provided to access and use the Service and to allow viewing and functionality of the Service) on a Device solely for your personal and non-commercial use and (ii) use certain Content that we may provide on the Service from time to time for your use as part of your User-Generated Content (defined in Section 4.1) (collectively referred to as "OurStarsClub Licensed Elements"), but only for the purposes explicitly stated at the time such OurStarsClub Licensed Elements are made available on the Service; however, we and our licensors and certain third parties, as applicable, retain ownership of such OurStarsClub Licensed Elements. The limited license mentioned in (i) does not grant you any ownership or any other intellectual property interest in any Content, and (ii) may be immediately suspended or terminated without liability to us in case of violation of these Terms of Service and/or non-compliance with the Applicable Policies.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may expand your access and permission to use the Content and/or OurStarsClub Licensed Elements, subject to the Additional Terms.</p>
VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND IN-GAME GOODS
The Service may include in-game virtual currency ("Virtual Currency"), such as credits, coins, money or points (e.g., diamonds and OurStarsClub coins), which may be purchased with real-world money or obtained through interactions with a third-party service. Virtual Currency may be used to buy in-game virtual items ("Virtual Goods"). Your purchase or winning of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods is merely a grant by us of a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal and non-transferable right to use the Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods as part of the Service under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms provided at the time. Consequently, you have no other interest, including no ownership, intellectual property, domain or monetary value, in your Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, which continue to be our Content and property.
Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods cannot be redeemed by you for cash, goods or other items of monetary value from the "real world" by any party. Transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods by you outside what we allow in the Service are strictly prohibited. This means you cannot buy or sell Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for real-world money or exchange items for value outside the Service.
OurStarsClub may run Special Campaigns targeted at you within the Service. Through these campaigns, you may receive the offer of in-game currency or in-game items in exchange for real money. For these targeted campaigns, OurStarsClub may use the age of your Account, recent purchase behavior and the number of times you have recently used the Service, which you shared with OurStarsClub when you created your Account, or consented to be analyzed.
By purchasing Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, you also expressly consent that such Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods will be provided directly to you and that OurStarsClub's performance of its corresponding obligations has begun. You therefore recognize that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final (i.e., you lose your right of withdrawal) and no refund will be provided by OurStarsClub, unless detailed otherwise in the applicable Additional Terms.
OurStarsClub has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods, and OurStarsClub will not be liable to you or any person for exercising such rights.

You will retain any ownership you may have over your User-Generated Content, but by this, you irrevocably grant Sulake a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, perform and exploit in any manner the User-Generated Content, or any part thereof, that you send to the Service or to Sulake, in any medium and format, whether known now or developed later, and to advertise, market and promote the same.
You declare that all User-Generated Content that you send to the Service and your contributions to User-Generated Content are fully original and that you exclusively own the rights to such User-Generated Content or contributions, and/or you have all necessary authority to grant all rights and licenses to Sulake under these Terms and/or any applicable Additional Terms, and that Sulake and its licensors may exercise such rights without Sulake or its licensors or successors incurring any third-party obligations or responsibilities.
We reserve the right to control and operate our Service in accordance with the Terms and applicable regulations. Regarding this, we may monitor User-Generated Content and your activities in connection with the Service, through automated monitoring systems and human moderation, but we cannot monitor or pre-screen all User-Generated Content.
We have the right, but not the obligation, to edit, refuse to publish or remove any User-Generated Content posted on the Service that we believe contains illegal activity or violates these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, or the spirit of these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms.
If you find something you believe contains illegal content and/or a violation of the Terms, you can inform us by contacting us through the OurStarsClub Help Tool. We will send you a confirmation that your notification has been received. We will inform you as soon as possible about the action we will take in response to your notification.

Unless otherwise specified in writing, all Content is owned, controlled or licensed by <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> or its licensors. All Content is protected by copyright laws and/or similar laws protecting it from unauthorized use.

<p>Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms, <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal and non-transferable license to (i) download (only temporary storage), view, display, use, reproduce and/or print a copy of the Content (excluding source code and raw object code or otherwise, except as provided to access and use the Service and to allow viewing and functionality of the Service) on a Device solely for your personal and non-commercial use and (ii) use certain Content that we may provide on the Service from time to time for your use as part of your User-Generated Content (defined in Section 4.1) (collectively referred to as "OurStarsClub Licensed Elements"), but only for the purposes explicitly stated at the time such OurStarsClub Licensed Elements are made available on the Service; however, we and our licensors and certain third parties, as applicable, retain ownership of such OurStarsClub Licensed Elements. The limited license mentioned in (i) does not grant you any ownership or any other intellectual property interest in any Content, and (ii) may be immediately suspended or terminated without liability to us in case of violation of these Terms of Service and/or non-compliance with the Applicable Policies.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may expand your access and permission to use the Content and/or OurStarsClub Licensed Elements, subject to the Additional Terms.</p>
VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND IN-GAME GOODS
The Service may include in-game virtual currency ("Virtual Currency"), such as credits, coins, money or points (e.g., diamonds and OurStarsClub coins), which may be purchased with real-world money or obtained through interactions with a third-party service. Virtual Currency may be used to buy in-game virtual items ("Virtual Goods"). Your purchase or winning of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods is merely a grant by us of a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal and non-transferable right to use the Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods as part of the Service under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms provided at the time. Consequently, you have no other interest, including no ownership, intellectual property, domain or monetary value, in your Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, which continue to be our Content and property.
Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods cannot be redeemed by you for cash, goods or other items of monetary value from the "real world" by any party. Transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods by you outside what we allow in the Service are strictly prohibited. This means you cannot buy or sell Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for real-world money or exchange items for value outside the Service.
OurStarsClub may run Special Campaigns targeted at you within the Service. Through these campaigns, you may receive the offer of in-game currency or in-game items in exchange for real money. For these targeted campaigns, OurStarsClub may use the age of your Account, recent purchase behavior and the number of times you have recently used the Service, which you shared with OurStarsClub when you created your Account, or consented to be analyzed.
By purchasing Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, you also expressly consent that such Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods will be provided directly to you and that OurStarsClub's performance of its corresponding obligations has begun. You therefore recognize that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final (i.e., you lose your right of withdrawal) and no refund will be provided by OurStarsClub, unless detailed otherwise in the applicable Additional Terms.
OurStarsClub has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods, and OurStarsClub will not be liable to you or any person for exercising such rights.
