    <!-- NEW SECTION: REFUNDS AND DIGITAL NATURE -->
    <h2>PART 5: DIGITAL GOODS NATURE AND REFUND POLICY</h2>

    <h3>21. STRICT REFUND POLICY AND FORCE MAJEURE</h3>

    <p><strong>21.1 "Auto-Consumed" Digital Products:</strong></p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that all digital items, gems, coins, and subscriptions ("Virtual Goods") purchased
      within the application are considered <strong>"Auto-Consumed" or "Consumable" products</strong>.
      <strong>Analogous to a food item that cannot be returned after consumption</strong>, once the digital license for
      a Virtual Good is released or delivered to your account, the service is deemed fully executed and finalized.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, <strong>we do not offer refunds</strong> for products that have already been delivered/licensed to the
      account, as they are considered consumed at the moment of delivery.</p>

    <p><strong>21.2 Force Majeure, Natural Disasters, and Server Shutdown:</strong></p>
    <p>The license to use Virtual Goods is revocable and dependent on the availability of the Service.
      <strong>No refunds will be issued</strong> in cases where the service is interrupted or terminated due to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, storms), wars, pandemics, or political
        instability.</li>
      <li><strong>Server Shutdown:</strong> Permanent or temporary discontinuation of the servers or the application
        itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Catastrophic technical failures resulting in the loss of account data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In these events, the license to use the Virtual Goods is automatically revoked without compensation.</p>

    <p><strong>21.3 No Refunds for Bans (Breach of Contract):</strong></p>
    <p>If your account is suspended, banned, or terminated due to a violation of these Terms (e.g., cheating, toxicity,
      harassment), <strong>you forfeit all rights to any Virtual Goods and balances.</strong> You acknowledge that you
      have read our contracts and are aware that no refunds will be given for loss of access due to your own breach of
      rules.</p>

    <p><strong>21.4 Exceptions (Fraud Only):</strong></p>
    <p>Refunds are strictly limited to the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proven Fraud:</strong> Cases where the transaction was flagged as fraudulent by the credit card issuer
        or bank (unauthorized use).</li>
      <li><strong>Judicial Order:</strong> Valid legal requests mandated by a court of law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests for refunds based on "regret," "accidental purchase" (after item use), or "dissatisfaction" are not
      accepted for digital consumable goods.</p>

    <h2>PART 6: ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>

    <h3>22. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
    <p><strong>21.4 Exceptions (Fraud Only):</strong></p>
    <p>Refunds are strictly limited to the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proven Fraud:</strong> Cases where the transaction was flagged as fraudulent by the credit card issuer
        or bank (unauthorized use).</li>
      <li><strong>Judicial Order:</strong> Valid legal requests mandated by a court of law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Requests for refunds based on <em>"regret,"</em> <em>"accidental purchase"</em> (after item use), or
      <em>"dissatisfaction"</em> are not accepted for digital consumable goods.
    </p>

    <h3>22.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
    <p>
      Your access to and use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by
      applicable law, the Service is provided <strong>"AS IS"</strong> and <strong>"AS AVAILABLE"</strong>,

      use.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      In no event shall the liability of <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> exceed the amount paid by you in the
      six (6) months immediately preceding the date of the claim. If no amount has been paid, your sole
      remedy shall be to cease using the Service and cancel your account.
    </p>

    <h3>24. JURISDICTIONAL LIMITATIONS</h3>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of
      liability. In such cases, the above limitations apply only to the extent permitted by law.
      Nothing in these Terms affects legal consumer rights or excludes liability for death, personal
      injury, gross negligence, or fraud.
    </p>

    <h3>25. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> and its affiliates
      from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising

    </p>

    <h3>26. USER GENERATED CONTENT</h3>

    <h4>40.1 IMPORTANT NOTICE</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.</strong> It establishes that you and
      <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> agree to resolve certain disputes through <strong>mandatory

    <h4>40.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h4>
    <p>
      By agreeing to these Terms, you and <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> agree that any and all disputes,
      claims, or causes of action, past, present, or future, arising from or related to these Terms, the
      Service, the formation of these Terms, or any other controversy between you and
      <strong>OurStarsClub</strong>, including its licensors, distributors, suppliers, or agents
      (including, without limitation, any app store or platform through which the Service is accessed or
      downloaded), regardless of whether it arose before or after the acceptance of this Section
      (collectively, <strong>"Dispute(s)"</strong>), shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration
      procedure described in this Section.
    </p>

    <p>
      You and <strong>OurStarsClub</strong> further agree that any arbitration conducted under the terms
      of this Section shall be held <strong>exclusively on an individual basis</strong>, and class
      actions, group actions, collective arbitrations, or representative actions are not permitted.
    </p>

    <h4>40.3 COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE</h4>

      which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you
      access and use the Service regularly.
    </p>

    <p>
      If more than one country meets this definition:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the country of your citizenship or legal permanent residence shall prevail; or
      </li>
      <li>

    <p>
      If your Country of Residence is located in the <strong>European Economic Area (EEA)</strong>, no

      as a consumer, in accordance with applicable legislation.
