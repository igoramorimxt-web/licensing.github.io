    <!-- NEW SECTION: REFUNDS AND DIGITAL NATURE -->
    <h2>PART 5: DIGITAL GOODS NATURE AND REFUND POLICY</h2>

    <h3>21. STRICT REFUND POLICY AND FORCE MAJEURE</h3>

    <p><strong>21.1 "Auto-Consumed" Digital Products:</strong></p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that all digital items, gems, coins, and subscriptions ("Virtual Goods") purchased
      within the application are considered <strong>"Auto-Consumed" or "Consumable" products</strong>.
      <strong>Analogous to a food item that cannot be returned after consumption</strong>, once the digital license for
      a Virtual Good is released or delivered to your account, the service is deemed fully executed and finalized.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, <strong>we do not offer refunds</strong> for products that have already been delivered/licensed to the
      account, as they are considered consumed at the moment of delivery.</p>

    <p><strong>21.2 Force Majeure, Natural Disasters, and Server Shutdown:</strong></p>
    <p>The license to use Virtual Goods is revocable and dependent on the availability of the Service.
      <strong>No refunds will be issued</strong> in cases where the service is interrupted or terminated due to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, storms), wars, pandemics, or political
        instability.</li>
      <li><strong>Server Shutdown:</strong> Permanent or temporary discontinuation of the servers or the application
        itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Catastrophic technical failures resulting in the loss of account data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In these events, the license to use the Virtual Goods is automatically revoked without compensation.</p>

    <p><strong>21.3 No Refunds for Bans (Breach of Contract):</strong></p>
    <p>If your account is suspended, banned, or terminated due to a violation of these Terms (e.g., cheating, toxicity,
      harassment), <strong>you forfeit all rights to any Virtual Goods and balances.</strong> You acknowledge that you
      have read our contracts and are aware that no refunds will be given for loss of access due to your own breach of
      rules.</p>

    <p><strong>21.4 Exceptions (Fraud Only):</strong></p>
    <p>Refunds are strictly limited to the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proven Fraud:</strong> Cases where the transaction was flagged as fraudulent by the credit card issuer
        or bank (unauthorized use).</li>
      <li><strong>Judicial Order:</strong> Valid legal requests mandated by a court of law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests for refunds based on "regret," "accidental purchase" (after item use), or "dissatisfaction" are not
      accepted for digital consumable goods.</p>

    <h3>ISENÇÃO DE GARANTIAS</h3>
    <p><strong>21.4 Exceptions (Fraud Only):</strong></p>
    <p>Refunds are strictly limited to the following scenarios:</p>

      especiais, punitivos ou exemplares, incluindo, sem limitação, perda de receitas,
      lucros cessantes, perda de dados, interrupção de negócios ou quaisquer perdas
      intangíveis, decorrentes ou relacionadas, direta ou indiretamente, ao seu acesso
      ou uso do Serviço, ao seu Conteúdo, ou aos seus direitos sob estes Termos ou
      quaisquer Termos Adicionais aplicáveis, independentemente da teoria jurídica
      invocada (contratual, extracontratual, negligência ou outra), ainda que a
      <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> tenha sido avisada da possibilidade de tais danos.
    </p>

    <p>
      Você concorda que, em nenhuma circunstância, a responsabilidade total da
      <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> excederá o valor efetivamente pago por você à
      <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> em relação ao uso do Serviço nos <strong>seis (6) meses</strong>
      imediatamente anteriores à data em que a reivindicação foi apresentada pela
      primeira vez.
    </p>

    <p>
      Caso você não tenha efetuado qualquer pagamento à <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> durante
      esse período, seu único e exclusivo recurso, bem como a responsabilidade
      exclusiva da <strong>ourstarsclub</strong>, será cessar o uso do Serviço e cancelar
      sua Conta.
    </p>

    <p>
      Se, por força de lei aplicável, tais limitações forem consideradas insuficientes,
      a responsabilidade máxima da <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> será limitada ao menor
      valor entre <strong>500 (quinhentos) euros</strong> ou o valor mínimo exigido pela
      legislação aplicável.
    </p>

    <h4>LIMITAÇÕES JURISDICIONAIS</h4>

    <p>
      Algumas jurisdições não permitem a exclusão de determinadas garantias ou a
      limitação ou exclusão de responsabilidade por certos tipos de danos. Assim,
      algumas das isenções e limitações acima podem não se aplicar a você.
    </p>

    <p>
      Na medida em que a <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> não puder, de acordo com a lei
      aplicável, excluir garantias ou limitar sua responsabilidade conforme previsto
      nestes Termos, tais garantias e responsabilidades serão limitadas ao mínimo
      permitido pela legislação aplicável.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nada nestes Termos de Serviço ou em quaisquer Termos Adicionais aplicáveis
      afetará os direitos legais irrenunciáveis de consumidores nem excluirá ou
      limitará qualquer responsabilidade por: <strong>(i)</strong> morte ou lesão
      pessoal decorrente de negligência grave ou fraude da <strong>ourstarsclub</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>INDENIZAÇÃO</h4>

    <p>
      Você concorda em indenizar, defender e isentar a <strong>ourstarsclub</strong>, bem
      como seus diretores, administradores, empregados, afiliadas, sucessores e
      cessionários, de toda e qualquer reivindicação, demanda, responsabilidade,
      dano, perda ou despesa, incluindo honorários advocatícios razoáveis, decorrentes
      ou relacionados a:

      <li>qualquer declaração falsa, enganosa ou deturpação feita por você.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Você concorda em cooperar integralmente conosco na defesa de quaisquer
      reivindicações. Não obstante qualquer disposição em contrário, a

    </p>

    <p>

    <h3>12. RESOLUÇÃO DE DISPUTAS, LEIS APLICÁVEIS, ACORDO PARA ARBITRAGEM INDIVIDUAL E PRAZO PARA APRESENTAR
      REIVINDICAÇÕES</h3>

    <h4>12.1 AVISO IMPORTANTE</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>LEIA ESTA SEÇÃO COM ATENÇÃO.</strong> Ela estabelece que você e a
      <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> concordam em resolver determinadas disputas por meio
      de <strong>arbitragem individual obrigatória</strong> e limita a forma como você e
      a <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> podem buscar reparação um contra o outro.
    </p>

    <h4>12.2 ACORDO DE ARBITRAGEM</h4>

    <p>
      Ao concordar com estes Termos, você e a <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> concordam que
      toda e qualquer disputa, reivindicação ou causa de ação, passada, presente ou
      futura, decorrente ou relacionada a estes Termos, ao Serviço, à formação destes
      Termos ou a qualquer outra controvérsia entre você e a <strong>ourstarsclub</strong>,
      incluindo seus licenciadores, distribuidores, fornecedores ou agentes (inclusive,
      sem limitação, qualquer loja de aplicativos ou plataforma por meio da qual o
      Serviço seja acessado ou baixado), independentemente de ter surgido antes ou
      depois da aceitação desta Seção (coletivamente, <strong>“Disputa(s)”</strong>),
      será resolvida de acordo com o procedimento de arbitragem descrito nesta Seção.
    </p>

    <p>
      Você e a <strong>ourstarsclub</strong> concordam ainda que qualquer arbitragem
      conduzida nos termos desta Seção será realizada <strong>exclusivamente em base
  individual</strong>, não sendo permitida a condução de ações coletivas, ações de
      grupo, arbitragens coletivas ou representativas.
    </p>

    <h4>12.3 PAÍS DE RESIDÊNCIA</h4>

    <p>
      Para fins desta Seção 12, <strong>“País de Residência”</strong> significa o país no
      qual você possui cidadania ou residência permanente legal, bem como qualquer país
      a partir do qual você acessa e utiliza regularmente o Serviço.
    </p>

    <p>
      Caso mais de um país atenda a essa definição:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        prevalecerá o país de sua cidadania ou residência permanente legal; ou
      </li>
      <li>
        se você possuir mais de uma cidadania ou residência permanente legal, será
        considerado o país com o qual você mantenha a associação mais estreita,
        considerando sua residência permanente ou uso mais frequente do Serviço.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Se o seu País de Residência estiver localizado no
      <strong>Espaço Econômico Europeu (EEE)</strong>, nenhuma disposição desta Seção 12
      excluirá, limitará ou afetará quaisquer direitos legais obrigatórios que você
      possua como consumidor, conforme a legislação aplicável.
